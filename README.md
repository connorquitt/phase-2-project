# Getting Started with the Media Diary
This app is a place to store every piece of media you've completed, from TV shows, movies, albums, or video games. Everything within the app should be pretty simple, on the homepage you'll need to click the go to diary button actually to access your entries, but you'll see all the cards you've made along with 5  text bars that are used to create a new entry, when you press the button it'll automatically add all the information for you. On each card there's a more info button that will bring you to a specific page with the extra information you gave that didn't get added to the card.

Good luck :)
